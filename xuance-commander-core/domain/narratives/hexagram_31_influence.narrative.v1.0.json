      "zh": "山上有澤，虛懷若谷，感應道交。你的感官現在極度敏銳，容易受到外界人事物的牽動。這是一種『共鳴』的狀態，你與某人或某事的頻率達到了同步。這帶來了強烈的吸引力，但也讓你容易失去自我邊界，隨波逐流。",
      "en": "Lake over Mountain; an open mind receives, resonance occurs. Your senses are extremely acute now, easily moved by external people and events. This is a state of 'resonance', where your frequency synchronizes with someone or something. It brings strong attraction, but also makes you prone to losing boundaries and drifting with the flow."

      "zh": "保持虛心，但要守住根基。接受這份感應，這或許是直覺在引導你。但在情感交流或合作中，要像山一樣穩重，不要像水一樣完全流失。真誠是關鍵，任何的虛情假意都會破壞這份磁場。順應這份吸引力，但保持內在的定力。",
      "en": "Stay humble/open, but hold your ground. Accept this resonance; perhaps intuition is guiding you. But in emotional exchange or cooperation, be stable like the mountain, not completely draining away like water. Sincerity is key; any falsehood will destroy this magnetic field. Follow this attraction, but maintain internal stability."
