      "zh": "天雷震動，萬物順應天性。你現在處於一種需要回歸『本真』的狀態。任何的機心、算計、過度規劃，在此刻都會失效甚至帶來災禍。你可能感到事情不如預期，那正是因為你試圖用『大腦』去控制『天命』。",
      "en": "Heaven and Thunder vibrate; all things follow their nature. You are in a state requiring a return to 'authenticity'. Any scheming, calculation, or over-planning will fail or bring disaster at this moment. You may feel things are not as expected; that is precisely because you are trying to control 'Destiny' with your 'brain'."

      "zh": "跟隨直覺，順勢而為。不要預設結果，不要為了利益而行動。保持像新生兒一樣的純真與誠實。如果有意外發生，不要驚慌，那是宇宙在自行重組你的軌道。這是一個『無為而無不為』的時刻，放下控制，你才會安全。",
      "en": "Follow intuition and go with the flow. Do not presuppose results; do not act for profit. Maintain the innocence and honesty of a newborn. If accidents happen, do not panic; it is the universe correcting your trajectory. This is a moment of 'doing nothing yet leaving nothing undone'; let go of control, and you will be safe."
