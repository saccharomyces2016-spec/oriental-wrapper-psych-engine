    "diagnostic_insight": {
      "zh": "風行地上，萬物皆顯。你現在不是『演員』，而是『觀眾』。你的氣場處於一種抽離、觀察的狀態。這可能源於你對現狀的困惑，促使你退後一步尋求全貌。這是一種神聖的停頓，如同祭祀前洗淨雙手的時刻，誠敬而專注。",
      "en": "Wind blowing over the Earth, revealing all things. You are not an 'actor' now, but a 'spectator'. Your energy field is in a state of detachment and observation. This may stem from confusion about the status quo, prompting you to step back and seek the full picture. This is a sacred pause, like the moment of washing hands before a sacrifice, sincere and focused."

    "action_guidance": {
      "zh": "多看少動。現在不是介入因果的時候，而是洞察規律的時刻。觀察他人的成敗，審視自己的內心。建立一個更高的視角（Metaview），像風一樣遍歷各地但不留痕跡。透過內省與觀察，你會在不動中獲得最大的智慧。",
      "en": "Watch more, act less. Now is not the time to intervene in causality, but to gain insight into patterns. Observe the successes and failures of others; examine your own heart. Establish a higher perspective (Metaview), traversing everywhere like the wind but leaving no trace. Through introspection and observation, you will gain the greatest wisdom in stillness."
