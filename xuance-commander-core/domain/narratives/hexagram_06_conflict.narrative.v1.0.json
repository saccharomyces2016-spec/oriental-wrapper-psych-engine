      "zh": "天向西轉，水向東流，氣場呈現『背道而馳』之象。這並非單純的外在爭執，而是你的內在頻率與當前環境產生了根本性的錯位。你感覺周遭充滿阻力，彷彿逆水行舟，越是用力辯解，誤解反而越深。這是因為能量流向不合，強行溝通只會引發更大的摩擦。",
      "en": "Heaven moves west, water flows east; the energy field shows a sign of 'divergence'. This is not merely external dispute, but a fundamental misalignment between your internal frequency and the current environment. You feel resistance everywhere, like rowing upstream; the harder you try to explain, the deeper the misunderstanding. The energy flows are incompatible, and forced communication only creates more friction."

    "action_guidance": {
      "zh": "此時『止』大於『行』。在氣場不合時，尋求勝利只會帶來悔恨。建議暫停所有爭辯與推進，退回到安全邊界內進行觀照。若此卦指向處理事務，請尋找公正的第三方或中間人作為緩衝。不要試圖獨自扭轉局勢，妥協不是認輸，而是為了保存能量。",
      "en": "At this time, 'stopping' is more important than 'acting'. Seeking victory when energies are misaligned only brings regret. It is recommended to pause all arguments and advancements, retreating to a safe boundary for observation. If you must handle affairs, seek a neutral third party as a buffer. Do not try to turn the tide alone; compromise is not defeat, but a way to preserve energy."
