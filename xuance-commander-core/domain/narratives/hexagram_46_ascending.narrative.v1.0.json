      "zh": "木生於地，順勢而長。你的氣場正在『穩步上升』。不同於『晉』的快速顯耀，『升』是緩慢、有機且扎實的成長。你就像一顆種子破土而出，雖然速度不快，但方向正確，阻力極小。這是一種柔順而堅韌的上升力量。",
      "en": "Wood growing in the Earth; rising with the flow. Your energy field is 'steadily ascending'. Unlike the rapid dazzle of 'Progress' (Jin), 'Ascending' is slow, organic, and solid growth. You are like a seed breaking through soil; though not fast, the direction is correct and resistance minimal. This is a gentle yet tough rising force."

      "zh": "積小成大，尋求指引。不要急躁，保持你的步調。向南（光明處）發展有利。尋找一位德高望重的導師或前輩，他們的指引能讓你少走彎路。就像樹木需要陽光，你也需要明確的目標來引導你的生長。",
      "en": "Accumulate small to become big; seek guidance. Do not be impatient; maintain your pace. Developing towards the South (brightness) is favorable. Find a respected mentor or senior; their guidance can save you from detours. Just as trees need sunlight, you need a clear goal to guide your growth."
