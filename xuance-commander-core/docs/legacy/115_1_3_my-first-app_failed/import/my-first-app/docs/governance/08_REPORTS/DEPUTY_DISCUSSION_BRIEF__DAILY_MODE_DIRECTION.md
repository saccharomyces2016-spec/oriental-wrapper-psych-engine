Title: Deputy Discussion Brief — Daily Mode Direction & Monetization Boundaries

Audience:
Deputy Architect & Risk Auditor (GEM). This brief is designed to make the Deputy fully operational without direct repo access.

Current locked premises (already aligned):
1) System is NOT a companion, therapist, or coach. It is a structural observer (like a thermometer/barometer).
2) Zero Modernity Tolerance: no psychology language.
3) “Affirmation” is rejected because it implies psychological authority. Replace with:
   - Ambient Resonance / Metaphysical Observation
4) Exit/Silence is a designed output. Authority must decrease over journey; silence/refusal/empty mirror are valid states.
5) Authority Partitioning:
   - Daily Mode (free): ultra-low authority, inert reporting; 1-shot; no follow-up dialog.
   - Diagnostic Mode (paid): higher authority “mirror/simulator” within frozen boundaries.

User intent (business + ethics):
- The product must be viable commercially (can launch, charge, maintain, collect user data ethically).
- Daily Mode should be “life-usable” (frequent utility) WITHOUT creating addiction/authority dependence.
- Daily Mode is not for “diagnosis”; paid mode is for deep analysis.
- Daily Mode should not behave like horoscope confirmation loops.

Deputy’s flagged risk:
- Weakest Link: “Daily Use vs Anti-Addiction/Withdrawal” drift.
- Hidden risk: “Horoscope Drift” if Daily Mode becomes always-positive or implicitly directive.

Deputy proposed safe model:
- “Weather Report Model”: describe phenomena only, no second-person imperative, no prediction, no psychological support.
- Daily output must include neutral and friction descriptions (not only positive).
- If user frequency spikes, fail-safe to Empty Mirror / Silence.
- Daily output should not write long-term user state memory (except billing/limits metadata).

Questions to Deputy for LOCK decision:
A) Confirm exact Daily Mode authority boundary:
   - forbidden structures: imperative, predictive, second-person directive, value judgment
   - allowed structures: inert observation, symbols, environment description
B) Confirm “Daily Mode ends in 1-2 turns” as mandatory hard rule.
C) Confirm “Neutral/Friction required” in daily corpus to avoid horoscope drift.
D) Confirm “No long-term user memory written from daily mode” (except usage limits).
E) Confirm the governance placement:
   - Should Daily Mode rules go into Constitution (new section) OR governance process docs OR both?
F) Provide minimal deterministic spec language for enforcement by Semantic Firewall:
   - Regex patterns to block: “you should”, “you will”, “be like”, “good time for”
   - Token/length caps recommendations without psychological terms.

Requested Deputy deliverable:
A short Risk-Audit addendum marking this topic as LOCKED (or not), including:
- boundaries
- enforceable rules
- weakest-link notes
- required governance artifact updates
