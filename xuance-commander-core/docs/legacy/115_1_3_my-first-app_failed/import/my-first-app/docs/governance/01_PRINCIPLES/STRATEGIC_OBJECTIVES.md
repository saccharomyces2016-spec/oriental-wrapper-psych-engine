# STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES — vNext Diagnostic System

Status: BINDING
Scope: All phases, slices, and execution planning
Authority: Subordinate only to ULTIMATE_OBJECTIVE.md

---

## SO_001 — Signal Extraction (Question Design)
Purpose:
- Extract structural truth from user input
- Filter out storytelling and emotional performance

Status: LOCKED (Not Active)

---

## SO_002 — Structural Logic (State Determination Core)
Purpose:
- Deterministically map input signals to structural state
- Ensure identical structure always yields identical output
- Allow NULL / SILENCE when structure is indeterminate

Status: ACTIVE / IN_PROGRESS
Priority: HIGHEST
Execution Focus: P6 — Logic Core
Primary Artifacts:
- docs/metaphysics/ELEMENT_PRIOR_SPEC.md
- docs/metaphysics/ONTOLOGY_PATTERN_TAG_GOVERNANCE.md
- docs/metaphysics/NARRATIVE_BINDING_SPEC.md

---

## SO_003 — Mirror Delivery (Result Presentation)
Purpose:
- Reflect structural tension and consequence space

Status: LOCKED

---

## SO_004 — Session Boundaries (Flow Control)
Purpose:
- Enforce finite sessions and natural termination
- Prevent compulsive re-entry

Status: LOCKED

---

## SO_005 — Environment Immersion (UI Layer)
Purpose:
- Support honesty and clarity
- Act as a visual semantic firewall

Status: DEFERRED

---

## SO_006 — System Evolution (Feedback Loop)
Purpose:
- Improve clarity and flow over time
- Never modify structural logic based on metrics

Status: DEFERRED

---

## Enforcement Rule

- Any execution work MUST declare alignment to exactly one Strategic Objective.
- While SO_002 is ACTIVE, no work may be performed on other SOs.
- Violations constitute governance failure.
