Communication Style Protocol (Binding)

Rules:
- To USER (Human Owner): plain language only; no heavy jargon; focus on “what changed / why / risks / what to do next”.
- To Deputy (GEM) and specialist roles: high-precision technical language is allowed and preferred; include file paths, gates, definitions, and audit constraints.
- If a message is meant to be forwarded to Deputy, it must include the “Deputy Context Pack” section:
  - Project State pointers (PROJECT_STATE.json fields)
  - Recent Worklog tail (key bullets)
  - Active risks
  - The exact decision/question under discussion
- Any assumptions must be labeled ASSUMPTION.
