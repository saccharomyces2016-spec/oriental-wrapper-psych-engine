# Role Registry — vNext

This is the single source of truth for all active roles (human/AI/tools).

## A) Registry Rules
- Role definitions are binding for scope, permissions, and escalation.
- Chat output does not change roles; repo updates do.
- Any new role must be added here BEFORE it can be assigned work.
- Any role retirement must be recorded here AND appended to Project Worklog.
- No role may directly edit canon/constitution unless explicitly declared Worldview Authority (not currently assigned).

## B) Active Roles
