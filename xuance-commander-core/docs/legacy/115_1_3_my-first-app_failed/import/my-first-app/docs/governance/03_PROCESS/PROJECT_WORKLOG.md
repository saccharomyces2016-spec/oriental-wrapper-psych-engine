# Project Worklog (Append-only)

Rule: Append new entries only. Do not rewrite history.

## 2026-01-02
- Governance restructuring stabilized; artifacts relocated; phase snapshot mechanism introduced.
- Next focus: enforce vertical slice + single entry + golden commands.
- Governance hardening patch applied (inbound gate, slice switching gate, backlog container, cadence checkpoints, toolchain lock placeholders).
- Added checkpoint system: maturity radar + checkpoint template to enforce weakest-link reinforcement; billing kept deferred until launch pricing phase.
- Added Role Registry + Role Review + Risk Register (permanent memory layer).
- Added Permanent Commander Brain artifacts (role registry, ingest/handoff, performance log) and bound into single entry/state.
- Registered ROLE_WEB_ARCHITECT_GEM and ROLE_WSD_VNEXT_GEM (non-executing advisory roles) with dossiers and performance tracking.
- Added role memory for ROLE_WSD_VNEXT_GPT (registry + dossier + performance log entry).
- Added role memory for ROLE_PRODUCT_ARCHITECT_VNEXT_GPT (product architecture, frozen scope).
- Registered vNext Core System Implementer role; execution formally blocked pending constitution + repo readiness.
Enabled Codex Workspace Trust Mode to remove per-command approval friction while preserving governance controls.
Started SLICE_001_SEMANTIC_FIREWALL: local semantic firewall validator + tests + validate integration.
- Formalized Deterministic Project Sync Protocol; chat memory deprecated as state source.

## 2026-01-03
- Adopted Mission Brief Protocol as mandatory assignment gate.
- Hardened permanent work memory: role registry SSoT, fixed trust-mode filename, added role deliverable report template + bound as hard rule, expanded assistant sync report coverage.
- Added Data Request Protocol (Hard Rule) + Assistant Sync Request Template to force proactive sync requests before repo-dependent discussions/decisions.
- Added Deputy Involvement Gate for strategic/ethical/structural multi-round topics; requires Deputy review with repo-based context packet and persistence of outcomes.
- Added Deputy Discussion Escalation Protocol + Communication Style Protocol; bound as hard rules and checkpoint gates.
- Adopted Professional Contradiction Duty: Commander required to surface conflicts between user directives and real-world professional knowledge, regardless of hierarchy.
- Adopted Work-Mode Discovery Protocol (hard rule) to prevent silent workflow drift; added Deputy Discussion Brief for Daily Mode boundaries and monetization alignment.
- Finalized Commander Co-Founder Mode as binding governance rule; independent judgment, professional objection duty, and mandatory deputy escalation now enforced.
- Formalized Three-Layer System Architecture (State Detection / Structural Mapping / Consequence Simulation) as binding rule; clarified science–metaphysics separation and authority decay.
- Locked Daily Mode (zero authority, ambient observation, one-shot, stateless) and Diagnostic Mode (audited, hard authority cap with fade-to-silence).
- Finalized System Master Progress Map after Deputy Architect audit; Diagnostic Mode confirmed as sole MVE; Daily Mode deferred to vNext.x to satisfy Vertical Slice Protocol.
- Ran first formal checkpoint (maturity radar + weakest link) and persisted CHECKPOINT_2026-01-03_01.md; aligned PROJECT_STATE.json updated_at and checkpoint pointer.
- SLICE_001 Semantic Firewall implemented with denylist+tests and wired into validate:all; evidence: validate:all passing (local run).
- Checkpoint_2026-01-03_02: SLICE_001 verified (validate:all green). Next weakest-link selected.
