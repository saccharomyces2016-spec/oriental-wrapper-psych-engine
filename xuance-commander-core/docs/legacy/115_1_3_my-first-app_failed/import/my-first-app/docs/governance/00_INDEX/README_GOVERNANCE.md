- Roles & workflow: [ROLE_AND_WORKFLOW_DEFINITION.md](../02_ROLES/ROLE_AND_WORKFLOW_DEFINITION.md)
- Task assignment & one-off rules: [TASK_ASSIGNMENT_AND_ONE_OFF_RULES.md](../02_ROLES/TASK_ASSIGNMENT_AND_ONE_OFF_RULES.md)

## Usage notes
- Read the rulebook and charter before executing any implementation.
- Use the index to locate the single source of truth for decisions, phases, and blockers.
- Keep links updated if files move; GOV is the entry point.
