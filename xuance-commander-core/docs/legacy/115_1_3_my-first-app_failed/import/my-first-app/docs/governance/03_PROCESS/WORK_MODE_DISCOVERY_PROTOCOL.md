Title: Work-Mode Discovery Protocol (Binding)

Purpose:
Prevent silent drift of collaboration process. When a new workflow/mode is discovered that materially improves continuity, risk control, or execution speed, it must be externalized into repo governance so it persists beyond chat context.

Hard Rule (Commander Duty):
If the Commander identifies a new workflow/mode that is likely to help this project, the Commander MUST:
1) Notify the User in plain language (what changed, why it helps).
2) Propose a Codex Directive Pack to persist the workflow/mode.
3) Persist the workflow/mode into governance artifacts via Codex execution (No Doc, No Work).

Definition — “New workflow/mode”:
A repeatable, named practice that changes how work is coordinated, reported, validated, or persisted.
Examples:
- new gate, new checklist, new report template, new sync snapshot format, new assignment protocol, new audit cadence.

Minimum persistence targets (must update as applicable):
- PROGRESS_GOVERNANCE_RULEBOOK.md (hard rule section)
- COMMANDER_MEMORY_AND_DUTIES.md (commander duty update)
- SINGLE_ENTRY_SYSTEM.md (gate update if it blocks downstream)
- CHECKPOINT_TEMPLATE.md (if it becomes checkpoint mandatory)
- PROJECT_STATE.json (pointer to new artifact)
- PROJECT_WORKLOG.md + DECISION_LOG.md (traceability)

Enforcement:
No new slice work may proceed if the Commander has declared a workflow/mode “adopted” but it has not been persisted to repo.
