Title: System Master Progress Map (Final, Audit-Compliant)

Mode Scope Correction (Critical)
- Daily Mode Engine: Status DEFERRED (vNext.x). Not part of MVE.
- The only MVE interaction loop is Diagnostic Mode (Relational Mirror).

Vertical Slice Compliance
- Phase 0002 and Phase 0003 focus exclusively on Diagnostic Mode.

Metaphysical Engine Deliverable Precision
- DONE criteria for Metaphysical Logic Engine:
  - docs/metaphysics/ELEMENT_PRIOR_SPEC.md
  - docs/metaphysics/NARRATIVE_BINDING_SPEC.md
  - docs/metaphysics/ONTOLOGY_PATTERN_TAG_GOVERNANCE.md

Success Definition (Reiterated)
- System success is defined as clarity + withdrawal.
