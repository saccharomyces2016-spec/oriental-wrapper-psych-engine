Title: Mission Brief Protocol (Binding)

Rule:
“No Brief, No Assignment.”
Any task assignment to any role is INVALID unless accompanied by a
complete Mission Brief generated from repository state.

Purpose:
Ensure all roles operate with full awareness of project state, history,
frozen laws, and active risks, regardless of chat context length.

Mandatory Inputs (Source of Truth):
- docs/governance/08_REPORTS/PROJECT_STATE.json
- docs/governance/03_PROCESS/PROJECT_WORKLOG.md
- docs/governance/04_DECISIONS/DECISION_LOG.md
- docs/governance/03_PROCESS/RISK_REGISTER.md
- Role dossier for the assigned role

Mission Brief MUST contain:
A) Current Project State
B) Frozen Laws & Governance Gates
C) Recent Work History (evidence-based)
D) Explicit “Do Not Repeat” list
E) Task Contract (scope, exclusions, DoD, reporting format)

Non-Compliance:
Any work produced without a Mission Brief is considered non-authoritative
and must not be merged, reviewed, or accepted.
