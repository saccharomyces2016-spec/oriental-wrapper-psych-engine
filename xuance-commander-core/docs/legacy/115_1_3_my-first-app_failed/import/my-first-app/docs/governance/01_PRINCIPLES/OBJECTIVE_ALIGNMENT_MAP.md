# OBJECTIVE ALIGNMENT MAP
## vNext Diagnostic System

This document defines how all existing and future work MUST align with the Ultimate Objective.
It functions as the single routing table between the Ultimate Objective and all execution work.

---

## L0 — Ultimate Objective (Immutable)

Defined in:
- docs/governance/01_PRINCIPLES/ULTIMATE_OBJECTIVE.md

This objective is non-negotiable and overrides all local optimizations, feature requests, and commercial pressure.

---

## L1 — Core Capabilities (What the system must be able to do)

### C1 — Signal Decoding (Input Understanding)
Accurately decode the user's internal state, external conditions, constraints, and conflicts,
independent of age, culture, nationality, or identity.
Structure extraction only. No judgment.

Aligned artifacts:
- Signal Detection Layer
- Ontology Pattern Tags

---

### C2 — Structural Logic (Problem Structure)
Transform decoded signals into a coherent structural representation
without psychology, moral judgment, or narrative meaning.

Aligned artifacts:
- Metaphysical Logic Engine
- ELEMENT_PRIOR_SPEC.md
- ONTOLOGY_PATTERN_TAG_GOVERNANCE.md

Critical dependency:
- Event 2 → Event 3 precision

---

### C3 — Trade-off Mirroring (Strategy, not Solution)
Expose structural strategies and trade-offs.


Aligned artifacts:
- Diagnostic Mode protocol
- Authority Decay rules

---

### C4 — Consequence Simulation (Chain Reactions)
Simulate downstream consequences if a structure is unaddressed
or handled in a specific way.
Simulation only, not prediction.

Aligned artifacts:
- Narrative Binding rules

---

### C5 — System Integrity & Continuity
Preserve internal coherence, safety, and long-term operability
under commercial and engagement pressure.

Aligned artifacts:
- Semantic Firewall (Product Core)
- Governance system
- Zero Modernity / Zero Psychology enforcement

---

## L2 — Execution Alignment Rule (Hard Rule)

1. Every Vertical Slice MUST declare exactly one Primary Core Capability (C1–C5).
2. Tasks inherit their slice alignment.
3. Any work not mappable to a Core Capability is INVALID.
4. Logic Core MUST NOT be modified for revenue, retention, or engagement metrics.
   Metrics may influence UI/UX only.

---

## Known Blocking Gap

Highest-risk blocker for fulfilling the Ultimate Objective:
- Event 2 → Event 3 (Structural Mapping → Metaphysical Logic Execution)

This gap has absolute execution priority.

---

## Enforcement

This document is binding.
Violations constitute architectural failure regardless of intent.
