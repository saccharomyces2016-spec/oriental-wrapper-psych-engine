# Role Review Template

Trigger: every checkpoint; when adding a role; when a role causes drift/violations.

| Role | Status (ACTIVE/PAUSED/RETIRED) | Last Deliverable (path) | Quality (OK/NEEDS_FIX) | Violations (None/Minor/Critical) | Notes (1–3 lines) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

Rule: never rewrite past reviews; log updates in PROJECT_WORKLOG.md as append-only entries.
