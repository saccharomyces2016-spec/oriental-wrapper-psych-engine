# Checkpoint — 2026-01-03 — 01
Branch: gov/cleanup-legacy-20260101-170835
HEAD: 4ff9ccbfedec26da17e7f53a4d716fe48be598e4
Active Slice: SLICE_001_SEMANTIC_FIREWALL

## Step 0) Mission Brief Verification
- Mission Briefs present for active assignments.
- References current PROJECT_STATE.json.
- Verification recorded in PROJECT_WORKLOG.

## Step 0A) Role Deliverable Report Check
- Latest milestones logged in ROLE_PERFORMANCE_LOG and PROJECT_WORKLOG.

## Step 0B) Sync Snapshot Presence
- Latest assistant sync report executed (npm run sync:assistant) prior to this checkpoint.

## Step 0C) Deputy Involvement Gate
- No new strategic/ethical multi-round topics requiring Deputy during this checkpoint.

## Step 0D) Multi-turn Topic Escalation
- No outstanding multi-turn decisions pending Deputy escalation.

## Step 0E) Work-Mode Discovery Check
- No new workflows adopted since last checkpoint.

## Step 1) State Synchronization Verification
- git status -sb clean; HEAD recorded above; PROJECT_STATE.json matches state.

## Step 2) Role Review Quick Pass
- No new roles added; existing roles unchanged since last review.

## Step 3) Maturity Radar Scoring (0–3)
| Dimension | Score (0–3) | Evidence Links | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Governance & Single Source | 2 | docs/governance/08_REPORTS/PROJECT_STATE.json | Governance artifacts current; first checkpoint recorded. |
| Vertical Slice Runnable | 1 | docs/governance/05_PHASES/PHASE_0002_CLOSEOUT.md | SLICE_001 not yet runnable; planning only. |
| Toolchain Reproducibility | 2 | scripts/assistant_sync_report.sh | Sync script covers state; local toolchain assumed available. |
| Core Safety Boundary | 1 | docs/architecture/specifications/THREE_LAYER_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md | Semantic firewall slice pending; authority decay rules defined. |
| Product Flow Skeleton | 1 | docs/architecture/specifications/DAILY_MODE_PROTOCOL.md | Daily Mode deferred; Diagnostic protocol defined but not implemented. |
| Billing & Licensing (DEFERRED) | 0 | N/A | Explicitly deferred. |
| Observability & Recovery | 1 | docs/governance/03_PROCESS/PROJECT_WORKLOG.md | Minimal logging; no observability stack yet. |
| Maintainability & Extensibility | 1 | docs/governance/03_PROCESS/PROJECT_WORKLOG.md | Architecture specs present; implementation pending. |

## Step 4) Weakest Link Selection
- Weakest dimension: Vertical Slice Runnable & Core Safety Boundary (tied at lowest runnable maturity).
- Justification: SLICE_001 semantic firewall not implemented; without enforcement gate, architecture rules unenforced.

## Step 5) Slice Definition (DoD-first)
- Scope: Implement SLICE_001_SEMANTIC_FIREWALL local semantic enforcement with denylist/regex and tests; wire into validate:all.
- Exclusions: No UI/LLM integration; no remote inference.
- DoD checklist: denylist evaluator; test coverage; validate:all integration; evidence in reports.
- Verification commands: npm test (semantic firewall tests); npm run validate:all.
- Evidence artifacts: test outputs; validate logs; updated PROJECT_STATE.json; worklog entry.
- Rollback plan: disable firewall hook and tests if blocking CI; retain docs.

## Step 6) Execution Gate ("No Evidence, No Work")
- Active plan updated: docs/governance/05_PHASES/PHASE_0002_CLOSEOUT.md
- PROJECT_STATE.json updated with latest checkpoint pointer.
- Worklog appended with checkpoint summary.
- Decision log appended with checkpoint record.

## Next Actions (max 3)
1) Owner: Codex — Implement SLICE_001 semantic firewall denylist + tests; integrate into validate:all; acceptance: tests and validate:all passing with evidence links.
2) Owner: Commander — Run follow-up checkpoint after implementation or context-risk; acceptance: new checkpoint file with updated scores and weakest link.
3) Owner: Codex — Add minimal observability notes for semantic firewall runs; acceptance: log path recorded in worklog/PROJECT_STATE.json once implemented.
