Three-Layer System Architecture (Binding)

Purpose

Define how the system collects user data, performs core analysis, and presents results using Eastern metaphysical language as an interpretive wrapper, while maintaining logical consistency, cross-cultural applicability, and long-term operability.

This architecture explicitly establishes modern psychology and data-driven analysis as the analytical core, with Five Elements, naming theory, and other Eastern metaphysical systems serving as semantic and cultural presentation layers.

⸻

Layer 1 — Data Collection & State Input Layer (Structured Intake)

Function:
Collect all relevant user inputs required for analysis, including but not limited to:
	•	Name
	•	Gender
	•	Date and time of birth
	•	Demographic context (if provided)
	•	Multi-stage questionnaire responses across multiple domains (family, relationships, work, study, finance, personal direction, etc.)

Methods Allowed:
	•	Structured questionnaires
	•	Multi-stage question groups
	•	Repeated question sets across different sessions
	•	Input normalization and validation

Explicitly NOT allowed:
	•	Direct interpretation or judgment
	•	Advice or solution generation

Rule:
This layer only gathers and normalizes data.
It does not analyze, interpret, or conclude.

⸻

Layer 2 — Core Analysis Layer (Psychology + Big Data Engine)

Function:
Analyze the user’s overall state, difficulties, and latent problem structures using:
	•	Modern psychology models
	•	Behavioral science frameworks
	•	Statistical inference
	•	Large-scale data comparison and pattern recognition

This layer is responsible for:
	•	Identifying what the user is currently facing
	•	Determining dominant problem categories and contributing factors
	•	Evaluating likely outcomes and risks based on aggregated data patterns

Rule:
	•	This layer is the sole decision-making and analytical authority of the system.
	•	All conclusions, solution directions, and consequence estimations originate here.

Constraint:
	•	The system does not claim medical diagnosis or therapeutic authority.
	•	Outputs are analytical and probabilistic, not clinical.

⸻

Layer 3 — Metaphysical Interpretation & Presentation Layer (Five Elements / Naming / Eastern Systems)

Function:
Translate the analytical outputs from Layer 2 into:
	•	Five Elements (五行) terminology
	•	Naming theory structures
	•	Eastern metaphysical and symbolic language

This layer exists to:
	•	Improve user comprehension and engagement
	•	Provide culturally resonant framing
	•	Present results in a non-clinical, non-alienating manner

Allowed:
	•	Metaphorical explanation using Five Elements
	•	Symbolic interpretation
	•	Narrative-style consequence descriptions

Forbidden:
	•	Altering or overriding analytical conclusions
	•	Introducing new logic not present in Layer 2

Rule:
This layer cannot generate conclusions independently.
It only reformats and expresses results already determined by the Core Analysis Layer.

⸻

Global Constraints
	•	Authority hierarchy:
Layer 2 (Core Analysis) > Layer 3 (Metaphysical Presentation) > Layer 1 (Input)
	•	No layer may override, bypass, or contradict the Core Analysis Layer.
	•	Presentation language must not change analytical meaning.
	•	Commercial optimization, UI adjustments, or engagement metrics must never alter Layer 2 logic.
