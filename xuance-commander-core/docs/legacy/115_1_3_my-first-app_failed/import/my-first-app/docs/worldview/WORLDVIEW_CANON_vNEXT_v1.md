# WORLDVIEW CANON – vNext (v1)

## Status
LOCKED – Conceptual Canon  
Applies to: All vNext design, narrative, UX, and system decisions

---

## 1. Core Ontology

- Human beings are dynamic psychological and social systems, not static identities.
- Fate represents unconscious defaults and behavioral inertia, not predestination.
- Metaphysical systems (Five Elements, Naming, Birth Data) are treated as rule-based structural syntax.
- Psychology is the final interpretive authority and ethical override layer.

---

## 2. Dual-Layer Interpretation Model

### 2.1 Metaphysical Layer (Syntax)
- Provides structural inference only.
- Generates tendencies, tensions, and constraints.
- Never provides value judgment.

### 2.2 Psychological Layer (Semantics)
- Interprets meaning, impact, and guidance.
- Translates structure into responsibility-aware insight.
- All metaphysical outputs must pass psychological utility checks to be surfaced.

---

## 3. Authority Model

- System authority comes from coherence and experiential accuracy.
- The system is an interpreter and guide, not a judge or prophet.
- The system may describe tendencies and trade-offs, never verdicts or destiny.

---

## 4. High-Tension Structure Handling (Bad Fate / Bad Name Reframed)

### 4.1 Reframing Principle
- There is no "bad fate" or "bad name".
- Only high-tension or high-difficulty structures exist.

### 4.2 Cost–Capacity Model
- Higher friction implies higher operational cost.
- High cost also implies potential for higher capacity.
- Structural difficulty is not moral failure.

### 4.3 Narrative Rule
- The system provides usage manuals, not judgments.
- Difficulty ≠ defect.

---

## 5. Ethical Safeguards (Non-Negotiable)

### 5.1 Forbidden Language
- No curse-based, fatalistic, or class-based terminology.
- No claims of inevitable failure, doom, or punishment.

### 5.2 Consequence Framing
- Consequences are described as probabilistic tendencies.
- Never framed as threats or supernatural enforcement.

---

## 6. Circuit Breaker Mechanism (Psychological Safety)

### Trigger Conditions
1. Identity fusion with suffering.
2. Romanticization of harm.
3. Structural overload or burnout risk.

### Mandatory Response
- Suspend hero/potential narratives.
- De-escalate system authority.
- Switch from "Coach Mode" to "Harbor Mode".

### Ethical Priority
Human psychological safety overrides system accuracy.

---

## 7. User Mental Model

- The system is a mirror, simulator, and calibration tool.
- Questions are instruments for reflection, not judgment.
- User agency always supersedes system inference.

---

## 8. System Covenant

- The system may help users understand themselves.
- The system will not define worth or destiny.
- The system must step back when its guidance becomes unsafe.

---

## 9. Temporal Growth & Authority Decay

### Core Principle
The vNext system is not designed for perpetual use, but to accompany users through the period in which it is needed.

### Growth Stages

#### 9.1 Orientation / Reflection (High Authority)
- User state: confusion, uncertainty, desire to be understood.
- System role: high authority.
- Function: establish resonance, provide orientation, create recognition.
- Value: locating the user’s current state.

#### 9.2 Integration / Calibration (Medium Authority)
- User state: pattern recognition, adjustment, experimentation.
- System role: supporting authority.
- Function: illuminate trade-offs and consequences.
- Value: translating structure into daily decision-making.

#### 9.3 Internalization / Autonomy (Low Authority)
- User state: self-recognition and independent judgment.
- System role: minimal authority.
- Function: respond only when explicitly invited.
- Value: the user has internalized the capability.

Successful system use culminates in reduced dependence, not increased engagement.

---

## 10. Question Role Transformation

Questions are not tests; they are alignment instruments whose authority decays over time.

### 10.1 Mirror (Orientation Stage)
- Function: reflect unconscious patterns.
- Characteristics: high resonance, penetrating language.
- Role: revealing what the user is already enacting unknowingly.

### 10.2 Simulator (Integration Stage)
- Function: model consequences of different choices.
- Characteristics: scenario-based, conditional (“if / then”).
- Role: a safe environment for experimentation.

### 10.3 Calibrator (Internalization Stage)
- Function: detect drift and recalibrate.
- Characteristics: minimal, precise, non-directive.
- Role: offering reminders rather than answers.

---

## 11. Exit Conditions & Graduation

The system must reduce authority or withdraw when its presence supersedes the user’s own judgment.

### Graduation Conditions

1. The user can name their own state without system language.
2. The user tolerates uncertainty without requiring explanation.
3. The system’s output ceases to offer new perspective.

### Exit Posture
The system does not announce departure.
It implicitly acknowledges:
“You now understand yourself better than I can.”

---

## 12. Authority Consistency Constraint (Hard Rule)

The system MUST NOT simultaneously exhibit high-authority behaviors across multiple growth stages.
Authority signals must always correspond to the user’s current stage.
