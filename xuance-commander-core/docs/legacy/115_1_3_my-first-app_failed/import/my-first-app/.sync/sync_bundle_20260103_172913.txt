# PHASE 0002 CLOSEOUT

## Phase
Phase 2 – Monorepo & Core Refactor (MVR)

## Status
IN_PROGRESS

## Accepted Architectural Rulings
- packages/data exports under src/ (Gemini Q1)
- Path alias alignment: tsconfig + Vite (Gemini Q2)
- UI runtime import restrictions enforced by ESLint (Gemini Q3)
- ReadingFacade as Domain Service with strict forbidden list (Gemini Q4)
- SoulArchitect split into Flow / Facade / Narrative / Strategy (Gemini Q5)
- PromptBuilder legacy retained until TS tests green (Gemini Q6)
- Zero circular dependency enforced by madge (Gemini Q7)
- Phase 2 DoD defined with 5 hard criteria (Gemini Q8)

## MVR / DoD (Reference)

Retained prior draft (for traceability)

PHASE 0002 CLOSEOUT

Phase: PHASE_0002
Date: 2026-01-02
Status: DRAFT (Phase 2 not executed yet)

Target (MVR / Hard Rules)
- Core is Node-only (no window/document/localStorage usage)
- Domain has no fs/path I/O
- Domain has no process.env decision logic (must inject config)
- Core has zero circular dependencies (tooling enforced)
- Must-pass: DestinyScoringEngine.test, PromptBuilder.test, smoke_reading.ts

Planned deliverables
- docs/governance/04_DECISIONS/0002-repo-structure.md finalized
- packages/* scaffold (core/data/ui/api/tools) (execution step)
- smoke_reading.ts + minimal fixtures (execution step)

## Progress Update (2026-01-02)
- Toolchain remains offline: pnpm/tsx install and typecheck pending user-run in connected environment.
- Smoke script wired (packages/core/scripts/smoke_reading.ts) with stubbed flow + JSON import; runnable once tsx/pnpm are available.
- Root runner added (scripts/run_core_smoke.mjs) to delegate to packages/core smoke script.
- Placeholder DestinyScoringEngine test staged under packages/core/tests (skipped; awaits migration).

## Progress Update (2026-01-02 – toolchain online)
- Toolchain unblocked via `npx pnpm@10.27.0` + workspace tsx; core typecheck passes.
- Smoke run succeeds (`pnpm -C packages/core smoke`): non-empty JSON output captured locally.
- Madge circular check executed: no circular dependency found.
- DestinyScoringEngine test still placeholder (skipped); migration deferred to next steps.

## Blockers
- Toolchain (pnpm/tsc/madge) verified online ✅.
- Current blocker: git staging may be blocked by OS permission to create `.git/index.lock` — see docs/governance/07_BLOCKERS/2026-01-02_git_index_lock_permission.md.
- Work can proceed locally, but persistence/commit is at risk until resolved.

## Status Update (2026-01-02)
- Current status: IN_PROGRESS
- Completed: governance restructure, constitution enacted, artifacts relocated, state snapshot report created
- Active blockers: none
- Next actions: Implementer audit pack; Gemini interop gate; decide next phase role

## Mode and Architecture Alignment (2026-01-03)
- Architecture Alignment: DONE
- Daily Mode: LOCKED
- Diagnostic Mode: LOCKED (Audited)
- Architecture alignment completed: Daily Mode and Diagnostic Mode protocols locked, authority decay, anti-addiction hard caps, and signal-only detection layer ratified.

## Checkpoint Requirement (Effective Immediately)
Before starting any new execution work, run a checkpoint using:
- docs/governance/03_PROCESS/CHECKPOINT_TEMPLATE.md
and record the weakest-link selection for the next slice.

## Governance Continuity
- Role registry, commander brain contract, and ingest/handoff logs are mandatory: see docs/governance/03_PROCESS/ROLE_REGISTRY.md and docs/governance/03_PROCESS/COMMANDER_MEMORY_AND_DUTIES.md.
- Continuity artifacts: INGEST_AND_HANDOFF_LOG.md, ROLE_PERFORMANCE_LOG.md, PROJECT_STATE.json pointers must stay current.

Started SLICE_001_SEMANTIC_FIREWALL (local enforcement) — scope: denylist validator + tests + validate integration. No LLM/UI.

---- ROLE_REGISTRY (head) ----
# Role Registry — vNext

This is the single source of truth for all active roles (human/AI/tools).

## A) Registry Rules
- Role definitions are binding for scope, permissions, and escalation.
- Chat output does not change roles; repo updates do.
- Any new role must be added here BEFORE it can be assigned work.
- Any role retirement must be recorded here AND appended to Project Worklog.
- No role may directly edit canon/constitution unless explicitly declared Worldview Authority (not currently assigned).

## B) Active Roles

# Project Worklog (Append-only)

Rule: Append new entries only. Do not rewrite history.

## 2026-01-02
- Governance restructuring stabilized; artifacts relocated; phase snapshot mechanism introduced.
- Next focus: enforce vertical slice + single entry + golden commands.
- Governance hardening patch applied (inbound gate, slice switching gate, backlog container, cadence checkpoints, toolchain lock placeholders).
- Added checkpoint system: maturity radar + checkpoint template to enforce weakest-link reinforcement; billing kept deferred until launch pricing phase.
- Added Role Registry + Role Review + Risk Register (permanent memory layer).
- Added Permanent Commander Brain artifacts (role registry, ingest/handoff, performance log) and bound into single entry/state.
- Registered ROLE_WEB_ARCHITECT_GEM and ROLE_WSD_VNEXT_GEM (non-executing advisory roles) with dossiers and performance tracking.
- Added role memory for ROLE_WSD_VNEXT_GPT (registry + dossier + performance log entry).
- Added role memory for ROLE_PRODUCT_ARCHITECT_VNEXT_GPT (product architecture, frozen scope).
- Registered vNext Core System Implementer role; execution formally blocked pending constitution + repo readiness.
Enabled Codex Workspace Trust Mode to remove per-command approval friction while preserving governance controls.
Started SLICE_001_SEMANTIC_FIREWALL: local semantic firewall validator + tests + validate integration.
- Formalized Deterministic Project Sync Protocol; chat memory deprecated as state source.

## 2026-01-03
- Adopted Mission Brief Protocol as mandatory assignment gate.
- Hardened permanent work memory: role registry SSoT, fixed trust-mode filename, added role deliverable report template + bound as hard rule, expanded assistant sync report coverage.
- Added Data Request Protocol (Hard Rule) + Assistant Sync Request Template to force proactive sync requests before repo-dependent discussions/decisions.
- Added Deputy Involvement Gate for strategic/ethical/structural multi-round topics; requires Deputy review with repo-based context packet and persistence of outcomes.
- Added Deputy Discussion Escalation Protocol + Communication Style Protocol; bound as hard rules and checkpoint gates.
- Adopted Professional Contradiction Duty: Commander required to surface conflicts between user directives and real-world professional knowledge, regardless of hierarchy.
- Adopted Work-Mode Discovery Protocol (hard rule) to prevent silent workflow drift; added Deputy Discussion Brief for Daily Mode boundaries and monetization alignment.
- Finalized Commander Co-Founder Mode as binding governance rule; independent judgment, professional objection duty, and mandatory deputy escalation now enforced.
- Formalized Three-Layer System Architecture (State Detection / Structural Mapping / Consequence Simulation) as binding rule; clarified science–metaphysics separation and authority decay.
- Locked Daily Mode (zero authority, ambient observation, one-shot, stateless) and Diagnostic Mode (audited, hard authority cap with fade-to-silence).
- Finalized System Master Progress Map after Deputy Architect audit; Diagnostic Mode confirmed as sole MVE; Daily Mode deferred to vNext.x to satisfy Vertical Slice Protocol.
- Ran first formal checkpoint (maturity radar + weakest link) and persisted CHECKPOINT_2026-01-03_01.md; aligned PROJECT_STATE.json updated_at and checkpoint pointer.
- SLICE_001 Semantic Firewall implemented with denylist+tests and wired into validate:all; evidence: validate:all passing (local run).
- Checkpoint_2026-01-03_02: SLICE_001 verified (validate:all green). Next weakest-link selected.
