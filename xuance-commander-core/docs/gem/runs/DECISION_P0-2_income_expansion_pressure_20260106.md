# DECISION｜P0-2｜income_expansion_pressure｜Commander
createdAt: 2026-01-06
scope: Phase 0 / MVP

## Inputs (evidence)
- R1 run: docs/gem/runs/RUN_P0-2_income_expansion_pressure_R1_20260106.md
- R4 run: docs/gem/runs/RUN_P0-2_income_expansion_pressure_R4_20260106.md
- SSOT: CHARTER / ROADMAP / CURRENT / AI_ADVISORY_ROLES / lessons+legacy

## Adopted decisions (locked)
1) Primary outward metaphor (user-facing): **R1 Blueprint A「歲時農耕・倉廩觀」**
   - reason: low barrier + stable segmentation + easier CN/EN rewriting without “test vibe”.

2) Riskchain structure (internal): **R4 Framework A/B**
   - rule: **all riskchains must be translated into Agrarian vocabulary** before reaching user-visible output.
   - keep excluded chains excluded (debt spiral / family discord / job loss panic).

## Next deliverables (P0-2)
- Questions (draft + options): based on Blueprint A sections (Weather/Granary/Seeds).
- Scoring: map options -> bands (4 bands) + thresholds.
- Reco + Narr: start R2 using this decision (no psych terms, no fearmongering, CN/EN native).
- Riskchains: implement mid/high chains with agrarian wording + breakpoints + observable signals.

## Done criteria for this decision
- Evidence files exist and are referenced in repo.
- ROADMAP/CURRENT mention this decision (avoid drift).
