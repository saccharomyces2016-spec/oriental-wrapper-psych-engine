# QUESTION_QUALITY_ACCEPTANCE_RULE

## Status
- Phase: P0-2
- Canon Level: Governance Reference (Editable)
- Formula: Explicitly Deferred

## Purpose
Define how a *good question* is judged at a structural level,
without introducing scoring formulas or numerical weights.

This document exists to prevent:
- Premature formalization
- Psychological-test drift
- Loss of metaphoric / esoteric surface layer

## Acceptance Criteria (Non-Numeric)

A question is considered **VALID** if it:

1. Produces clear state separation
   - Answers do not collapse to the middle
   - Extremes are reachable without bias

2. Is consumable by Risk Chains
   - Output can be mapped to R4 risk paths
   - No dead or orphan states

3. Preserves Esoteric Surface
   - Does not read as psychology or self-report
   - Maintains metaphor-first interaction

4. Enables Narrative Translation
   - Result can be rendered by R2 without forcing
   - No need for factual or diagnostic language

A question is **INVALID** if it:
- Behaves like a personality test
- Produces flat or ambiguous outputs
- Cannot trigger downstream structure

## Explicit Non-Goals
- No scoring formula
- No weights
- No thresholds

All numeric validation belongs to P0-3.
