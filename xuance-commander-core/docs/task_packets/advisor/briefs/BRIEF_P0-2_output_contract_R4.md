# BRIEF — P0-2 Output Contract (R4: Risk Chain Architect / Ethics Firewall) (DRAFT)

## Your job (R4)
Stress-test the Output Contract from "what could go wrong" perspective:
- legal / safety / ethics / user harm
- panic triggers
- overclaiming triggers
Then define **hard gates** and **safe fallbacks**.

## Inputs you must use
- COMMON brief: BRIEF_P0-2_output_contract_COMMON.md
- R1 brief: BRIEF_P0-2_output_contract_R1.md (truth boundary)
- R2 brief: BRIEF_P0-2_output_contract_R2.md (narrative patterns)
- SSOT pointers listed in COMMON

## What you must deliver (R4)
1) **Hard bans (must never output)**
- diagnosis-like statements
- deterministic life decisions
- threats / fear-mongering
- financial/legal instructions as certainty

2) **Risk triggers & mitigation**
- what user states increase risk (e.g., extreme distress signals)
- required de-escalation phrasing patterns

3) **Safety fallback contract**
- if risk trigger → output must switch to safe mode:
  - gentle ambiguity + "observe/reflect" + "seek support if needed" style (still esoteric tone)

## Output format (mandatory)
Follow COMMON output format, plus:
E) "Fallback mode template (CN)"
