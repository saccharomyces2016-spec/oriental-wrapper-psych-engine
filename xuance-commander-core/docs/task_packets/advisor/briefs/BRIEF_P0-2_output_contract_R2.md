# BRIEF — P0-2 Output Contract (R2: Esoteric Narrative Designer) (DRAFT)

## Your job (R2)
Turn allowed internal conclusions into **user-facing esoteric narrative** that:
- feels "accurate to the bone"
- is safe (no diagnosis / no deterministic life commands)
- does not expose modern psychology terms

## Inputs you must use
- COMMON brief: BRIEF_P0-2_output_contract_COMMON.md
- R1 brief: BRIEF_P0-2_output_contract_R1.md (truth boundary)
- SSOT pointers listed in COMMON

## What you must deliver (R2)
1) **Esoteric Output Archetypes (5–10)**
- Each archetype includes:
  - what it can say / cannot say
  - 2–4 line CN example output

2) **Banned words / phrases**
- List terms that would leak internals or trigger "psych test" feeling

3) **Abstraction rules**
- How to keep it symbolic while still being concrete enough to be useful

## Output format (mandatory)
Follow COMMON output format:
A) Archetypes
B) Forbidden rules (wording-level)
C) Boundary translation rules
D) Open questions
