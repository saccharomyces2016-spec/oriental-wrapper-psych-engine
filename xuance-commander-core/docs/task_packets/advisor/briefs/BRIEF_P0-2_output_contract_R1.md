# BRIEF — P0-2 Output Contract (R1: Assessment Designer) (DRAFT)

## Your job (R1)
Define **what the engine truly knows** vs **what is only narrative wrapping**.
Your output is the "truth boundary" that the Output Contract must not violate.

## Inputs you must use
- COMMON brief: BRIEF_P0-2_output_contract_COMMON.md
- SSOT pointers listed in COMMON

## What you must deliver (R1)
1) **Inference Capability Table (MVP)**
- List the internal signals / variables that are reliable enough to support outputs
- List what is explicitly NOT knowable from current inputs

2) **Allowed Conclusion Levels**
- Define 3–5 levels of "conclusion concreteness"
  (e.g., energy state → tendency → risk direction → actionable suggestion threshold)

3) **Hard No-go List (R1 perspective)**
- Specific examples of conclusions that would be "overclaiming"
- Examples of "sounds accurate but unsupported"

## Output format (mandatory)
- Section 1: "We can reliably infer…"
- Section 2: "We cannot infer…"
- Section 3: "Allowed conclusion levels (L1–L5)"
- Section 4: "No-go examples (CN)"
