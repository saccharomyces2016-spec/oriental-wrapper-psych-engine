# P0-3 Narrative Sharpness / Esoteric Precision
Status: ACTIVE (DRAFT)
Scope: Narrative quality rules ONLY. No UI. No new prohibitions.

## Objectives
A) Sharpness Metrics v1 (measurable narrative quality)
B) Narrative Skeleton v1 (L1–L4 fixed cadence + slots)
C) Esoteric Lexicon & Mapping v1 (precision without expansion of authority)
D) Diversity Controls v1 (avoid eight-legged clichés; keep consistency)

## Out of Scope
- UI / Visual
- Marketing copy
- New prohibitions beyond P0-2 (unless critical risk found → proposal only)
- Large scenario library expansion

## Definition of Done
- Metrics, Skeleton, Lexicon, Diversity all present (v1)
- No L5 leakage
- Reproducible evaluation examples
