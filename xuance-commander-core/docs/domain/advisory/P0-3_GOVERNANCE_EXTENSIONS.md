# P0-3 Governance Extension: Expandable Metaphor Domains

## Status
ACTIVE — Editable by Governance Decision  
(All changes require proposal → review → approval)

## Core Principle
Primary worldview remains **Agricultural / Granary Civilization**.
Narrative richness is achieved by expanding **approved sub-metaphor domains**,
not by mixing foreign worldviews.

All narrative output MUST stay within registered domains.
Cross-domain mixing without approval is a hard fail.

## Approved Expandable Metaphor Domains (Current)

### 🌾 Cultivation Actions
播種、休耕、培土、除草、過度開墾

### 🏚 Structural Load & Bearing
地基、牆體、裂縫、坍塌、補強

### 🌧 Weather & Seasonal Cycles
旱、澇、霜、雪、梅雨、節氣錯位

### 💧 Irrigation & Water Systems
溝渠、水閘、滲漏、回流、淤塞

### 🐭 Attrition & Erosion
鼠害、蟲咬、霉變、風蝕

### 🔥 Energetic States
燥、熱、濕、寒、火盛、氣滯

## Governance Rule
- Advisors MAY propose new metaphor domains.
- Proposals MUST include:
  - Domain definition
  - Example vocabulary
  - Boundary with existing domains
- Final inclusion requires Owner Decision.
- Rejected domains are NOT to be referenced in narrative output.

## Design Intent
This structure ensures:
- Perceived narrative depth for users
- Strict machine-checkable boundaries
- Zero impact on existing P0-3 conclusions
