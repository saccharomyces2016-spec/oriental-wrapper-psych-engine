# P0-2 Phase Closure Record

## Phase Objective
Lock semantic structure, roles, and narrative intent
without introducing numerical evaluation.

## Completed
- Advisor roles stabilized (R1–R4)
- Risk chain structure confirmed
- Question intent clarified
- Governance-first approach enforced

## Deferred
- Scoring formulas
- Quantitative validation
- Golden test execution

## Rationale
Numerical systems introduced too early create false stability
and violate the project's reversibility principle.

## Next Phase
P0-3: Question Validation & Scoring Exploration
